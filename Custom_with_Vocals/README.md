# Custom Script: Phases 02, 03, and 04

## Overview
This script processes a specific audio file (`2h30m3h08m-vocals.wav`) by applying the following phases from the main audio pipeline:

1. **Phase02**: Splits the audio into smaller segments.
2. **Phase03**: Separates voices or instruments from the audio segments.
3. **Phase04**: Enhances the quality of the separated audio.

The outputs are saved in well-organized directories for easy access.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Ensure the following dependencies are installed:
  ```bash
  pip install demucs librosa soundfile torch voicefixer openunmix ffmpeg-python
  ```
- FFmpeg: Ensure FFmpeg is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.

## File Structure
Place the script in the root of the project directory, which includes:
```
Audio_Processing_Pipeline/
├── script_debug.py          # Main pipeline script
├── 2h30m3h08m-vocals.wav    # Input audio file
├── Custom_Processing_Output/  # Output directory (generated by the script)
└── custom_script_phase_2_3_4.py  # This custom script
```

## Usage
Run the script directly using Python:
```bash
python custom_script_phase_2_3_4.py
```

## Output Structure
The script generates outputs in the `Custom_Processing_Output` directory, organized as follows:
```
Custom_Processing_Output/
├── Phase02_Segments/          # Audio segments from Phase02
├── Phase03_Separated_Voices/  # Separated voices from Phase03
└── Phase04_Final_Enhancements/ # Enhanced audio files from Phase04
```

## Customization
### Segment Duration
You can modify the segment duration (in seconds) by changing the `SEGMENT_DURATION` variable in the script:
```python
SEGMENT_DURATION = 60  # Default: 60 seconds
```

### Input File
To process a different audio file, replace `2h30m3h08m-vocals.wav` with the desired file name:
```python
INPUT_FILE = "your_audio_file.wav"
```
Ensure the file is placed in the project root directory.

## Notes
- The script uses classes (`Phase02`, `Phase03`, `Phase04`) from the main pipeline (`script_debug.py`). Ensure the main pipeline script is in the same directory.
- Ensure sufficient storage space for the output files, especially for long audio inputs.

## Troubleshooting
1. **FFmpeg Not Found**:
   - Ensure FFmpeg is installed and added to your system's PATH.

2. **Dependencies Missing**:
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required packages.

3. **Empty Output**:
   - Verify the input file exists and is accessible.
   - Check for errors during each phase.

## Acknowledgments
This script builds upon the main audio processing pipeline to provide a focused workflow for specific use cases.
